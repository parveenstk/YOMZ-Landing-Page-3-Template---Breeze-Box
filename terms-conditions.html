                    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

                    <p>By accessing, browsing, or using the website, products, or services offered by YOMZ, you acknowledge
                    that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, as well as our
                    Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference. These Terms apply to all users of our
                    platform, including but not limited to visitors, customers, and contributors of content. If you do
                    not agree with any part of these Terms, you must immediately discontinue your use of YOMZ services.
                    YOMZ reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, and cancel
                    orders at its sole discretion, where necessary, to protect its interests or comply with applicable
                    law.</p>

                    <p>All intellectual property, including but not limited to text, images, graphics, logos, product
                    designs, software, and other materials displayed or made available through YOMZ, is the exclusive
                    property of YOMZ or its licensors and is protected by applicable copyright, trademark, and
                    intellectual property laws. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative
                    works from any YOMZ content without prior written consent. Any unauthorized use of the YOMZ name,
                    logo, or materials may result in legal action. YOMZ grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
                    non-transferable, and revocable license to use our services for personal and lawful purposes only,
                    and this license does not include the right to resell, commercially exploit, or otherwise misuse our
                    offerings.</p>

                    <p>You agree to use YOMZ services solely for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe
                    upon or restrict the rights of any third party. You must not engage in any activities that could
                    damage, disable, overburden, or impair the operation of our website or related systems. If you
                    create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information
                    and for all activities carried out under your account. You must notify YOMZ immediately if you
                    suspect unauthorized use of your account. YOMZ is not liable for any losses or damages resulting
                    from your failure to safeguard account credentials.</p>

                    <p>YOMZ provides its services and content “as is” and “as available,” without any warranty or
                    representation, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that our services will be
                    uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free from harmful components such as viruses. To the fullest
                    extent permitted by law, YOMZ shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
                    consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising
                    out of or relating to the use or inability to use our services, even if YOMZ has been advised of the
                    possibility of such damages. Any reliance on materials obtained through YOMZ is solely at your own
                    risk.</p>

                    <p>YOMZ reserves the right to update, modify, or replace these Terms and Conditions at its sole
                    discretion at any time, and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting on our website.
                    Your continued use of YOMZ services after any changes are posted constitutes acceptance of those
                    changes. If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
                    shall remain in effect.</p>
