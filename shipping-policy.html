                    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>

                    <p>At YOMZ, we are committed to ensuring that your orders are delivered quickly, securely, and in
                    excellent condition. This Shipping Policy explains how we process, ship, and deliver products, along
                    with important details on timelines, charges, and responsibilities. By placing an order with YOMZ,
                    you agree to the terms described below.</p>

                    <p>We begin processing all orders within 1–2 business days of receiving payment confirmation, excluding
                    weekends and public holidays. Orders placed after 5:00 PM IST will be processed the following
                    business day. During festive seasons, promotional sales, or unexpected high-demand periods, order
                    processing may take longer. If a delay is expected, our team will notify you via email or phone to
                    keep you updated on the status of your shipment.</p>

                    <p>Our deliveries are handled by trusted courier partners to ensure speed and reliability. For domestic
                    deliveries within India, you can typically expect your order to arrive within 3–7 business days
                    after dispatch. For international shipments, the delivery timeframe ranges from 7–21 business days,
                    depending on customs clearance and the destination country’s postal efficiency. While these are
                    standard estimates, delivery times may be extended due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our
                    control, such as weather conditions, natural disasters, or courier service disruptions.</p>

                    <p>Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on your location, the size, and the weight of your
                    order. Any applicable charges will be displayed before you confirm your purchase. From time to time,
                    YOMZ may offer free or discounted shipping promotions, which will be clearly stated on our website
                    and will apply only under the specified terms. International customers should note that import
                    duties, customs fees, and taxes (if applicable) are not included in the shipping charges and must be
                    paid directly to local customs authorities.</p>

                    <p>Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an email or SMS containing your tracking number
                    and a link to monitor your shipment. Please allow up to 24 hours for tracking updates to appear
                    after dispatch. It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the delivery address provided is
                    accurate and complete. In case of failed deliveries due to incorrect address details, unavailability
                    of the recipient, or refusal to accept the package, the order may be returned to YOMZ. If
                    re-shipment is required, additional shipping charges will apply.</p>

                    <p>While we strive for punctual deliveries, certain delays are beyond our control. These include, but
                    are not limited to, customs inspections, courier strikes, political unrest, and public holidays in
                    the delivery region. In such cases, our customer service team will work with the shipping partner to
                    resolve the issue and ensure your order reaches you as soon as possible. However, YOMZ cannot be
                    held liable for delays caused by such external factors.</p>

                    <p>If your order arrives damaged, is lost in transit, or is missing items, you must contact YOMZ within
                    7 days of the expected delivery date or receipt of the package. Please include photographs of the
                    damaged packaging and product to help us file a claim with the courier service. Depending on the
                    situation, we may offer a replacement, repair, or refund at our discretion. We take packaging and
                    delivery safety seriously and will always work towards a satisfactory resolution for our customers.</p>
