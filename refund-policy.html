                    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

                    <p>At YOMZ, customer satisfaction is our top priority. We understand that sometimes a product may not
                    meet your expectations or arrive in the condition you anticipated. This Refund Policy outlines our
                    guidelines for processing returns, issuing refunds, and handling exchange requests. By making a
                    purchase from YOMZ, you agree to the terms below.</p>

                    <p>We offer refunds or replacements for eligible products returned within 7 days of delivery. To
                    qualify for a refund, items must be unused, in their original packaging, and in the same condition
                    in which they were received. Certain products, such as perishable goods, personalized items, digital
                    downloads, or items purchased during clearance sales, are non-refundable unless they arrive damaged
                    or defective. We reserve the right to decline refund requests that do not meet these eligibility
                    criteria.</p>

                    <p>If your order arrives damaged, defective, or incomplete, please contact our customer support team
                    immediately, but no later than 48 hours after delivery. You must provide photographs or videos
                    clearly showing the issue, along with your order details, to help us process your claim. In such
                    cases, we will arrange for a replacement, repair, or refund depending on product availability and
                    your preference. Refunds will be processed only after we verify the reported issue.</p>

                    <p>For returns due to reasons other than damage or defect—such as a change of mind, incorrect size, or
                    unwanted gift—the customer is responsible for all return shipping costs. Products must be shipped
                    back to us using a trackable method, and a tracking number must be shared with our support team. If
                    the returned item is not received in its original condition, YOMZ may deduct a restocking or damage
                    fee from the refund amount.</p>

                    <p>Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of
                    your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed within 7–10 business days to your original
                    payment method. Depending on your bank or payment provider, it may take additional time for the
                    refund to reflect in your account. If your refund is rejected, we will provide an explanation and,
                    where possible, offer alternative resolutions such as store credit or an exchange.</p>

                    <p>Please note that certain delays in refund processing are beyond our control, such as banking
                    holidays, payment gateway issues, or international transaction timelines. While we always strive to
                    process refunds promptly, YOMZ cannot be held liable for delays caused by third-party financial
                    institutions.</p>

                    <p>For orders placed outside India, customs duties, taxes, and shipping charges paid by the customer
                    are non-refundable. If a return is initiated from outside India, the customer is responsible for
                    ensuring that the package is correctly declared and shipped to avoid additional customs penalties or
                    delays. We recommend consulting your local customs office before sending an international return.</p>
